# My-First-Coding-Portfolio
My coding portfolio website

## Description
This is my first portfolio website that will host all of my completed projects in the future. So far, there is no functional navigation since I need to add the Javascript later to enable it. 

## HTML Methodology
My portfolio website is subdivided into three distinct categories: About Me, Projects, and Contact Me. There is still room in the original html source code to inject Javascript at a later date to add more functionality for my portfolio website. 

## CSS Methodology
The main guts of my portfolio website can be seen here and showcases the decisions I made whilst going through the design process. I chose to create a layout that was more vertical in nature and that would correctly resize the total size of the website based on which device is accessing it. There is additional CSS for the navigation elements that do not appear for now, but, will work later on when I add the Javascript to enable the navigation bar to appear.
